By the end of this laboratory session, you should be able to do the following.
* Understand the different mask layers that make up the layout of an inverter.
* Manually extract the circuit schematic of a 12-transistor logic gate from its layout.
* Use Cadence's Virtuoso tool package to connect up a 4-bit LFSR circuit from Lab 1.
* Use Cadence's Calibre tool package to verify that your layout passes DRC and LVS checks.
* Verify that your "hand-wired" circuit works properly through simulation.
